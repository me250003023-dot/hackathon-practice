# [QC Hack 2022 / Xanadu](https://github.com/XanaduAI/QHack2022)

> QHack is a world-renowned annual quantum hackathon that takes your education to the next level and helps you connect with others in the quantum community.

The QHack Coding Challenge is a set of 25 quantum coding challenges.

The Challenge problems are divided into 5 categories:

- PennyLane 101
- Quantum Algorithms
- Quantum Machine Learning
- Quantum Chemistry
- Quantum Games

Each category contains 5 problems worth differing amounts of points: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500. The PennyLane 101 category is intended primarily as a tutorial so you can get used to the submission process, as well as learn the basics of PennyLane, the software library in which all the problems are written.
